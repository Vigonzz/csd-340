    <p class="intro">
        Life has been pretty intresting throught these past few years. Truthfully I never expected to get this far in life, such as going to college, or following a dream.
        <span class="sentence">I have been an employee for the Disneyland Resorts for three years now and, as cheesy as this may sound, I found such solice with Disney;
        they have been there to support me and all of my dreams.</span> Take this class for an instacne, or even me getting a degree, I really couldn't have done it without them. I don't have 
        many people in my life but for the ones that are around, I want to try my best to make them proud. Therefore, I wat to work hard to learn as much as I can and create the best programs there is.

        Finding something I was truly passionate about was slighlty hard since I love so many things. However, one thing has never
        changed and that is my ambition to be apart of the STEM feild. First I wanted to do engineering, than math, and now coding. As a kid I grew up with video games. 
        I constanlty played them on diffferent concels and watched other play as well. As I became older and finally as an adult, I now have my own money to buy 
        the games that I want. I decided to buy the parts to make myself a PC and during tht process I became in love with computers and how they talked. The things was, 
        this was different than the rest of my "likes." I geniunly loved learning about computers. I started with understanding their language, binary, and found the world 
        of different languages for software development. I was atonished on how much it could do, and everything made sense.
    </p>

        A part of me really wants to create my own game, but as I keep exploring the actuallity of each role offered witin software development, I found myself, being more comftorble 
        with front-end development, and found comfort on the creativity that still prospers in that specific role. However, I have not given up on making a game yet. As I am working on ym portfolio 
        for hopefully graduate school, I decided to focus on making a online 2d game using phaser. I decided to use pixel art, because I gained inspiration from a cozy game I play, Stardew Valley. I loved the
        artisitc take of pixel art as it felt nostalgic. I also really love how high resolution pixel art looks, but I decided to have my assets stick to baisc pixel art.

        Now that you know a bit about my passion, it can also help explain more about myself as well. I am a homebody, which is why I find thos feild even more amazing because I can stay at home and 
        create things endlessly. However, there are times when I do want to go out. When I venture outside, I like to be in nature; hencforth, I love to hike and go camping. Typically if I am out in nature I enjoy 
        partaking in some fun, so often times, I will go cliff jumping, or even kayaking. My faviorte activity would have to be ocean kayaking, it's both peacfull and thrilling, especially if you explore caves in your kayak.
        I want to travel the world and learn about different cultures. Hopefully with a profound knowledge of different connections, I can create truly immersive products for people to enjoy.
